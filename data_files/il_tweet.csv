Pritzker has been able to accomplish not just in Illinois, but nationwide. Exactly one year ago today, he was re-elected. In that *one year*, he has - Signed into law the first-in-the-nation ban on book bans. - Banned Assault Weapons - Ensured Women's reproductive freedoms as rights. - Lowered Health Care costs. In addition, he just launched and sank millions of dollars of his own money into one of the most data driven and concerted efforts to defeat Republicans in swing states in Democratic Party history. Dubbed ""Think Big America"", the non-profit has already yielded incredible dividends for Democrats. In Ohio, TBA gave $250,000 to the constitutional abortion measure. It passed. In Virginia, TBA gave $250,000 to state legislature candidates to defeat Republicans attempts to take over the only chamber they don't have. Democrats won. And TBA has already given a Nevada PAC aimed at enshrining abortion as a right $1,000,000 ahead of 2024. He's delivered an insane amount for not just Illinois, but for the country, and in a *very* short period of time. And he's literally just getting started.
